# JewelKit-Manual
JewelKit: An Educational Plug-in for Rhino CAD. JewelKit is an educational plug-in for Rhino CAD, designed specifically for students learning CAD for the first time and for their educators.
Smart Shank Tools: Automatically snaps profile curves to the ring rail's top and bottom quadrants for high-precision modeling.
Signet Builder: Offers parametric design workflows for Oval, Rectangle, and Crest signet shapes.
3D Printing Optimized Mesh: Instantly converts 3D geometry into high-quality meshes suitable for additive manufacturing.
Material Analysis: Estimates the final weight of the piece in grams (g) based on a database of preset jewelry materials.
Quality Checklist: An integrated tool for users to self-evaluate the printability and wearability of their designs.

Shank & Rail Tools
JK_CreateRail: Generates the foundational ring rail based on international sizing standards.
JK_CreateProfile: Places the cross-sectional profile curves onto the rail's quadrants.
JK_CreateShank: Sweeps the profiles along the rail to generate the 3D shank geometry.
Signet Ring Builder
JK_SignetGuides: Instantly creates the parametric guide curves for Oval, Rectangle, or Crest shapes.
JK_SignetSolid: Builds the 3D solid body of the signet ring from the active guides.
JK_CreateCutter: Generates the cylindrical cutting object for the finger hole.
JK_CutHole: Executes the final Boolean operation to finish the ring.
Manufacturing & Analysis
JK_CreateMesh: Converts the design into a high-density mesh optimized for 3D printing.
JK_Weight: Opens the material density calculator to estimate the final weight in grams.
